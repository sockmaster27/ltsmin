TODO make hint about:
    vector_set.c:(.text+0x1199): undefined reference to `bn_init'
    ./src/bignum/bignum.h:35:extern void         bn_init_copy (bn_int_t *a, bn_int_t *b);

GENERAL NOTES:
- TODO: Check if flex installation in install script (install.sh) is good enough. Maybe a make error? If no error when running make, delete this note.
- root/lib should not be necessary with cmake, as it is used to increase portability between systems. Cmake should be able to do that itself. https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2018-January/066885.html
    - Files that might be needed from root/lib: verify.h
NEW DEPENDENCIES?
    - LTDL was given with automake in src/m4/ltdl.m4. cmake can't use this. an other dependency is needed. As standard i think linux comes with an ltdl library

----------------root-----------------


---------------src/hre----------------
    TODO: FILE:git_version.h is generated. Figure our how
    config.h.in need to use #cmakedefine in order for cmake to create the config.h dynamically. You need to SET(__linux__ ON) at some point in order for __linux__ to be defined.
    TODO: FILE:config.h.in Right now __linux__ is hard coded: make a way to dynamically check and set operating system version. I don't know where it is done in the automake version
    TODO: FILE:config.h.in check if  _GNU_SOURCE is defined correctly 
    
    
---------------src/ce---------------- OPTIONAL
    TODO: this is not done. is an optional modules that only is create if HAVE_CE is ON.
    
---------------src/ltmin-libs----------------
    .lemon and .l files are used for generation of .c and .h files with lemon and flex
    TODO: It looks like on the old automake code that generating lex files is optional. Look into this.
        
        
---------------lemon---------------------
    Lemon is used to generate files from .lemon files (eg. src/ltsmin-libs/ltsmin-grammar.lemon)
    It uses lempar.c to generate these files, BUT not a compiled version of lempar.c. Therefore lempar.c is copied into the binary directory. I'm unsure if this is the best approach
        
---------------ltl2ba--------------------
    NOTE: root/ltl2ba/config.h file is created with the root/config.h.in. This file is currently empty. Unsure if it's needed.
        SUGGESTION: this config.h should maybe be the same as root/src/hre/config.h
