GENERAL NOTES:
- Check if flex installation in install script is good enough. Maybe a make error? If no error when running make, delete this note.

----------------root-----------------
Unsure what ltsmin should be build as? a library needs sources, and an excecutable creates an executable (which automake does not do)


---------------src/hre----------------
    Note: FILE:hre_malloc has compiler error, does not seem to be necessary for autotools to configure the whole project. The error is in the "RTalign" function. You just need to declare ret in the start of the function.
    TODO: Check if other sources can be left out for making of project.
    TODO: FILE:git_version.h is generated. Figure our how
    TODO: FILE:config.h.in Right now __linux__ is hard coded: make a way to dynamically check and set operating system version. I don't know where it is done in the automake version
    TODO: FILE:hre_run_time.c. (compile-error)On linux i get "CPU_SETSIZE is undeclared". is fixed by putting #define _GNU_SOURCE on top of the file (line 2). RIGHT NOW hre_run_time.c IS NOT INCLUDED IN CMAKEMAKELISTS.
    
---------------src/ce---------------- OPTIONAL
    Note: bufs.c: can't find mpi.h
    Note: Ddlts.c: can't find mpi.h
    Note: I don't know what mpi.h is or where to find/generate it. I cannot find it in the automake build version. A LOT OF FILES DEPEND ON mpi.h in ce: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26920083/fatal-error-mpi-h-no-such-file-or-directory-include-mpi-h
    
---------------src/ltmin-libs----------------
    .lemon and .l files are used for generation of .c and .h files with lemon and flex
    TODO: It looks like on the old automake code that generating lex files is optional. Look into this.
    TODO: uncomment ltl2spot.cpp and make it depend if spot is enabled or disabled
        
        
---------------lemon---------------------
    Lemon is used to generate files from .lemon files (eg. src/ltsmin-libs/ltsmin-grammar.lemon)
    It uses lempar.c to generate these files, BUT not a compiled version of lempar.c. Therefore lempar.c is copied into the binary directory. I'm unsure if this is the best approach
        
---------------ltl2ba--------------------
When making with cmake it needs a config.h that was created by autotools  (i suggest to create it with configue_file(config.h.in config.h) and manually create a config.h.in)    
       also remove config.h.in from gitignore
TODO: GITERROR:"ltl2ba cannot be made with cmake" in gitmodules change from "url = https://github.com/codermann63/ltl2ba.git" to u"rl = https://github.com/utwente-fmt/ltl2ba.git"
       


---------------src/pins-lib: --------------------
      Note: is dependend on generated files from ltsmin-libÂ¨
        TODO: convert subdirectory por and add it as subdirectory to CMakeLists.txt

---------------src/pins2lts-sym---------------------
    TODO: check if all compiler flags are given like the automake version

---------------src/vset-lib---------------------
    Note: a lot of optional content. I've tried to copy the options from the automake script
    TODO: vset_listdd64.c could not find config.h. I've changed the include to hre/config.h (because vset_listdd has and include for hre/config.h). CHECK IF CORRECT
---------------src/util-lib---------------------
    QUESTION: fast_set.c has an include to config.h. Automake does not generate one with its make and fast_hash.c has an include to hre/config.h. I've changed the include to hre/config.h. TODO check if correct
            ADDITIONAL INFO: fast_set.h has include of hre/config.h
            TODO: the same problem with simplemap.h 
---------------src/dm---------------------
    TODO: In the Makefile.am there is specified a debug and nonddebug library. MAYBE CHANGE SO CMAKE HAS DEBUG AND NON-DEBUG
